# CSCI2020U-Final-Project

This project was created by Michael Mazzilli, Brendan Szeto, Nandu Pokhrel, Sajantth Sripirakasan, and Faizah Afreen.
Any code submitted was a collaborative effort between the group.

This program allows the user to play a game of Blackjack against an AI dealer. The rules of Blackjack can be found here https://www.pagat.com/banking/blackjack.html

The final program was coded using VSCode, with a built-in Gradle extension. To run this code, open CSCI2020_finalProj-master in VSCode, and run the Main.java file. Another way of running it is to run the .jar file for the project. You can find this file with the path CSCI2020_finalProj-master/build/dist/BlackJackFX

You can also run the .jar file through IntelliJ, by opening the project, then changing the configuration to Jar, then setting the file path to match the one above, and then running it.
